## üöÄ How to Run

To run this project, you'll need **PostgreSQL** installed and a **Bash** environment (like Linux, macOS, or Git Bash on Windows). This project was developed in a Gitpod virtual machine provided by freeCodeCamp.

### 1. Database Setup

First, create the database and tables, and populate the `services` table.

```bash
# 1. Create the 'salon' database
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE salon;"

# 2. Connect to the 'salon' database and create tables
psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=salon <<EOF
CREATE TABLE services (
  service_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE appointments (
  appointment_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT NOT NULL,
  service_id INT NOT NULL,
  time VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (service_id) REFERENCES services(service_id)
);

-- Populate initial services
INSERT INTO services (name) VALUES ('cut'), ('color'), ('perm');
EOF
